\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

% broad introduction of like... what the issue is, why do we care

% Then, begin to focus in on the possibility of using astrophysical GW sources, and why it's relevant (tests have already passed in weak field, non-dynamical regime... and provide citations... now time to look in the strong-field, highly-dynamical regime)

% introduce BBH acroynm up here

% Then...
In the remainder of Section \ref{sec:intro}, we describe the three phases of a BBH merger (Section \ref{sec:intro_anatomy-bbh}), \TODO{number} of the leading alternative theories to general relativity that have been tested thus far (Section \ref{sec:intro_alt-theories}), and a parametric framework for quantifying deviations from general relativity (Section \ref{sec:intro_ppE}). \TODO{maybe add something about how sections II, III, IV each describe some characteristic examples of the tests we can do in each phase...} In Section \ref{sec:inspiral_pn_expansion}, we describe the application of a parametric post-Newtonian expansion to gravitational wave emission in the inspiral phase, and modifications at various orders provided by alternative theories of gravity. In Section \ref{sec:nr_merger}, we describe the challenges involved in accurately modeling the merger phase, and highlight some of the numerical techniques used to solve fully non-linear theories of gravity in order to generate gravitational wave predictions from the merger phase. In Section \ref{sec:ringdown_qnms}, we describe the "quasi-normal modes" of the merged black hole as it relaxes asymptotically to a Kerr state and modifications to these modes under different theories. In Section \ref{sec:current_obsv}, we discuss current comparisons with observations and briefly mention some of the statistical methods used to perform these tests. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, we provide a summary of the work described and a discussion on how future improvements, both in theoretical understanding and observational capacity, will allow us to provide rigorous constraints on deviations from general relativity.

\subsection{Alternatives to General Relativity} \label{sec:intro_alt-theories}
A number of alternative theories to general relativity may be better described as modifications or extensions of Einstein's theory. 

% dCS
% Einstein dilaton Gauss-Bonnett
% a third one?
% ref something more recent thant he appendix of Yunes, Pratorius... but from those same guys
